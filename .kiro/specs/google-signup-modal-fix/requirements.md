# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Google OAuth sign-in flow is not properly triggering the SignupModal for new users. When users click "Continue with Google" and authenticate with a Google account that hasn't been registered in the system before, they should see a signup modal to collect their first name and last name. Currently, this modal is not appearing, preventing new users from completing their registration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user signing in with Google for the first time, I want to see a signup modal to enter my personal information, so that I can complete my account registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with Google" AND successfully authenticates with Google AND their Google account is not already registered in the system THEN the system SHALL display the SignupModal
2. WHEN the SignupModal is displayed THEN the system SHALL pre-populate any available information from the Google profile (email, display name if available)
3. WHEN the SignupModal is displayed THEN the system SHALL require the user to enter their first name and last name
4. WHEN the user submits valid information in the SignupModal THEN the system SHALL create a new user record in Firebase
5. WHEN the user record is successfully created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user signing in with Google, I want to be taken directly to the dashboard without seeing the signup modal, so that I can access the application quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Continue with Google" AND successfully authenticates with Google AND their Google account is already registered in the system THEN the system SHALL redirect directly to the dashboard
2. WHEN an existing user signs in THEN the system SHALL NOT display the SignupModal
3. WHEN an existing user signs in THEN the system SHALL load their existing user data from Firebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling in the Google OAuth flow, so that users receive clear feedback when authentication fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN Firebase user creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL display a network error message
4. WHEN the user cancels the Google OAuth popup THEN the system SHALL return them to the login page without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the signup modal to validate my input properly, so that I can understand what information is required and in what format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user leaves the first name field empty THEN the system SHALL display "First name is required"
2. WHEN the user leaves the last name field empty THEN the system SHALL display "Last name is required"
3. WHEN the user enters non-alphabetic characters in name fields THEN the system SHALL display "Only letters allowed"
4. WHEN the user enters names shorter than 2 characters THEN the system SHALL display "Minimum 2 characters"
5. WHEN the user enters valid names THEN the system SHALL allow form submission
