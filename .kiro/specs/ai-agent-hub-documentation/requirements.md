# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AI Agent Hub is a modern AI conversation platform designed with a ChatGPT-like interface, featuring OpenRouter API integration and the ability to connect with various datasets. The system supports a Multi-Agent Architecture where each agent has specialized expertise and can work together to provide comprehensive and efficient services.
