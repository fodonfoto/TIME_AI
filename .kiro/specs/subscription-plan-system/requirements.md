# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a subscription plan system that manages user access levels and enforces AI request limits based on their chosen plan. The system will track user subscriptions, monitor daily AI usage, and enforce limits to ensure fair usage across different pricing tiers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have a subscription plan assigned to my account, so that I can access AI features according to my plan's limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL assign them to the Free plan by default
2. WHEN a user's plan information is requested THEN the system SHALL return their current plan type and remaining daily requests
3. IF a user has no plan assigned THEN the system SHALL default to Free plan restrictions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on the Free plan, I want my AI usage limited to 5 requests per day, so that the service remains sustainable for free users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Free plan user makes an AI request THEN the system SHALL check if they have remaining requests for the current day
2. IF a Free plan user has used 5 requests today THEN the system SHALL reject further requests with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN the day resets (midnight UTC) THEN the system SHALL reset the Free plan user's request count to 0

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on the Pro plan, I want my AI usage limited to 100 requests per day, so that I have sufficient capacity for professional use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pro plan user makes an AI request THEN the system SHALL check if they have remaining requests for the current day
2. IF a Pro plan user has used 100 requests today THEN the system SHALL reject further requests with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN the day resets (midnight UTC) THEN the system SHALL reset the Pro plan user's request count to 0

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on the Ultra plan, I want unlimited AI requests, so that I can use the service without restrictions for enterprise needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Ultra plan user makes an AI request THEN the system SHALL always allow the request regardless of usage count
2. WHEN an Ultra plan user's usage is tracked THEN the system SHALL record the usage for analytics but not enforce limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track and store user subscription data in the database, so that I can manage user plans and usage effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user subscription data is stored THEN the system SHALL include plan type, start date, and current usage statistics
2. WHEN a user's plan is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of plan changes
3. WHEN querying user data THEN the system SHALL efficiently retrieve plan information and usage statistics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current plan status and usage information, so that I can monitor my consumption and plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their plan information THEN the system SHALL display their current plan type
2. WHEN a user requests usage information THEN the system SHALL show requests used today and remaining requests (if applicable)
3. IF a user is approaching their daily limit THEN the system SHALL display a warning message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages when I exceed my plan limits, so that I understand why my request was rejected and what options I have.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exceeds their daily limit THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message explaining the limit
2. WHEN a limit is reached THEN the system SHALL suggest upgrading to a higher plan
3. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL include information about when limits will reset
